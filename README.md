# Loops And Subdivisions
This project is based on Entagma's tutorial: https://entagma.com/loops-subdivisions/
the tutorial teachs how to recursively subdivide and deform geometry.

Animating the Extrude parameters results in an interesting animation

Overall I found this setup pretty intuitive and creative, I would definatly expand on in on the future
